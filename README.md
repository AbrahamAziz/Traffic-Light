# Traffic-Light
The purpose of this project was to create two functioning traffic lights that were inverse of each other. The amount of time the light stayed on, was by adding the last two digits of your student number and adding 3, which represented the amount of seconds the traffic light was green, and the traffic light was yellow for 1 second. The amount of time the traffic light was red, was equal to the amount of time the traffic light was green and yellow added up together. The traffic light was created by using quartos, which was a program installed on the computer, and an Altera board to see if the program that was created in quartus was functional or not. The traffic light was composed of three modules. The first module was the frequency divider, this allowed the clock to be on and off on its own, which made the seconds in the traffic light. The next module that was made was the cycle timer, this module counted the amount of seconds needed before a transition occurred, which was based on your student number. The last module that was created was the output controller, this allowed transitions between the lights on the traffic light to occur.
